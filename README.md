# web-scraping
Create a Python script to automate data extraction from Wikipedia pages. The script will retrieve HTML content, extract article titles and text, collect internal links, and consolidate these tasks into one function that accepts a Wikipedia URL. This will be tested on a specific Wikipedia page to validate functionality.

1) Write a function to Get and parse html content from a Wikipedia page

2) Write a function to Extract article title

3) Write a function to Extract article text for each paragraph with their respective

headings. Map those headings to their respective paragraphs in the dictionary.

4) Write a function to collect every link that redirects to another Wikipedia page

5) Wrap all the previous functions into a single function that takes as parameters a Wikipedia link

6) Test the last function on a Wikipedia page of your choice
